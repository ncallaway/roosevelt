## Prerequisites ##
To build and run the unit tests, you will need the [Google C++ Testing Framework](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/).

Download and extract to a folder named `gmock` and placed within this test directory. From the project root, you should have a folder like:

    gtest/include
	
## Building ##

    cd build
	cmake .. -G "Your Generator" (ex: cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 11")
	[build generated files!]
